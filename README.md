# archinstall-aur
Archinstall plugin concept to handle AUR packages.<br>
Will not work unless https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/pull/393 is merged in.

ðŸš¨ Important: This is not something that will ever be shipped with archinstall or the archinstall guided installer. This repo serves as an example to show how plugins can be created to enrich archinstall with external functions that experienced users can optionally install and optionally use.
